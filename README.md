# Dino Survival

A simple text-based dinosaur survival game inspired by the BBC "Big Al" game. The player controls a juvenile carnivorous dinosaur that must hunt to survive and grow. Different geological settings define the available species and terrain types.

## Features

- Turn based actions: move or hunt on each turn.
- Random terrain that affects the type of prey encountered.
- Support for multiple settings such as the Morrison Formation or Hell Creek.

## Requirements

The game only requires Python 3.8+.

## Running the Game

```bash
python dino_game.py
```

Running the script opens a full-screen menu with buttons for the available
settings. Choose **Morrison** or **Hell Creek** to start the text-based game in
the terminal. Use commands `north`, `south`, `east`, `west` to move and `hunt`
to try to catch prey. The **Quit** button exits the program.
